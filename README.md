My master's thesis - An inclusive rhythm serious game for visually impaired and sighted children

Players play locally in teams of two. One player is the guide and the other the performer. 

The guide holds the two (HTC Vive Pro) VR controllers and receives vibrations to be informed about the time and the direction of the notes coming. Thus, is responsible to inform the performer to hit the notes at the right timing. 

The performer must listen the directions of the guide, and hit the notes using the left and the right arrow keys of the keyboard. 

If the guide is a pupil with low vision can choose whether to play with haptics or visuals. If the performer is a pupil with low-vision will play blind-folded. 

When a note is hitted succesfuly you hear a drum and a slam sound. When a note is misshited you hear only a drum sound. The drum and slam audio are spatial to help the visually impaired children knowing what's happening in the game.

Every succesfull hit counts for 3 points. The game objective is to collect as many points as possible. 

Note: To close the applicaton, press Escape.
